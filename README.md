HammyBot is a bot I am just making for fun.  
It is supposed to be functional, but easy to add additional features to.  It's not exactly the greatest feat of programming,
but it is meant to just be for personal use.
In order to use this bot, you must just create your own token.txt file with the only line being your discord token
